DID:
1- a single handler for all interactions (liking posts or comments).
2- removed root auth to fix routing, now the initial page is the home page.
3- better formatting for displaying categories whether in home page or post details.
4- indicator for when a post has no comments instead of leaving it empty.
5-finalize css.


TODO:
1- add auth in home handler (or js), to display the correct button, login for non authed users and logout for authed users.
2- filters.
