DID:
1- a single handler for all interactions (liking posts or comments).
2- added auth in the home page to show the correct button for the user (login if unAuthed and logout if Authed)
3- removed root auth to fix routing, now the initial page is the home page.
4- better formatting for displaying categories whether in home, post details and userinfo pages.
5- indicator for when a post has no comments instead of leaving it empty.
6- added userinfo page handler


TODO:
1- filters.
2- finalize css.
